1. Violations of Design Principles
	a. Encapsulate what varies
	b. Composition over inhertitance
	c. Program to interfaces, not implementations
	d. Strive for loose coupling
	e. Open Close Principle
	f. Principle of least knowledge
2. Poorly written design patterns
	a. Strategy
		-target field is concrete not abstract

		-observes concrete classes not abstract/interface
	c. Decorator Pattern
		-forgot to change existing method
	d. Template Method
		-forgot final access mod
	e. Adapter
